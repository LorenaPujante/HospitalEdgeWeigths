# HospitalEdgeWeigths
In this repository, we show which are the weights for the edges of the knowledge graph (KG) used in [~~doi: TODO~~](NULL). Specifically, these weights are for the edges related to the spatial dimension of the domain represented with the KG. This KG was used as a basis for the work "_Spatiotemporal Data Modelling for Epidemiological Research in Hospitals_" [10.1109/JBHI.2024.3417224](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568325).
To be more specific, the weighted edges are those from a more recent version of the KG that can be found in the following repository: [LorenaPujante/HospitalKG_Changes](https://github.com/LorenaPujante/HospitalKG_Changes)
